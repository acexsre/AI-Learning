# Welcome to the AI Learning Hub

Welcome to your one-stop destination for learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) — whether you're a curious beginner or a seasoned developer looking to expand your knowledge.

## 🚀 What This Site Offers

This documentation is designed to be **hands-on, beginner-friendly**, and **modular**, here I'll not be covering a wide range of Old Age AI topics like, as these are essentials but we have multiple abstractions. 

- 🤖 **Fundamentals of AI** – Learn the core concepts that drive modern AI systems.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning (ML)** – Dive into algorithms, model training, and evaluation.
- 🧮 **Deep Learning** – Explore neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.
- 🧰 **Practical Tools** – Work with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

Instead I'll focus on penning down all the topics that Im learning during VibeCoding a couple of AI projects.

- How to Use LLMs.
- Tools comparison. 
- Documenting how to setup AI based tools with K8S and other DevOps tools in picture.

## 🛠 Who This Is For

This guide is ideal for:
